Version 0.4
===========

0.2 and 0.3 were project-internal releases. As we do not want to fsck up existing
builds we are thus jumping up to 0.4.

The unsung hero and most valuable player of this release is Florian Wohner who
did all the important parallelization work.

This was a rather ''interesting'' release. We switchted to the bouncycastle crypto
library and allowed modular arithmetic (mostly to try GF^257 based cryptographic
algorithms). Later we found out, that the performance was really hurt as Java does
not provide any preprocessor-like functionalities that would allow for efficient
switchable mathematics.

This in turn was followed by a period of minimization and reducing options. Florian
added the really important Rabin parallelization code as well as additional
cryptographic algorithms.

To sum up, on a four core processor we have an encoding improvement for Shamir of
+107%, Rbin +670% and for Krawcywk with Salsa20 of +167%. Decoding got improved
too: shamir +204%, Rabin +140% and Krawczyk by +98%.

Chapman Flack (1):

Florian Wohner (35):

 * linkXRef is not a valid element in checkstyle:check
 * add IntelliJ files to .gitignore
 * project-wide whitespace cleanup
 * fix rabin ids and krawczyk css not returning smaller arrays; add tests Rabin (and therefore Krawczyk) should return arrays of size ceil(original_length/k) but in fact returned arrays of size original_length padded with lots of zeroes. this is now fixed, but the fix is complicated by the fact that we possibly also use block ciphers that use 16 byte blocks (and also add an extra block at the end)
 * fix test to correctly calculate size of shares (and add another test) once again that thing with the block ciphers; added a test using a ChaCha20 stream cipher
 * a little optimization to the block ciphers to only truncate arrays when necessary
 * implement new on-disk format for shares
 * permit empty files again, but check and convert nulls; add test
 * increment version number
 * document share format
 * add two small UML diagrams (PlantUML syntax)
 * add rationale for current on-disk format
 * add partial reconstruction option
 * add a (generated, then edited) overview class diagram
 * change reconstructPartial interface; better test this adds a parameter to the method to indicate the starting point of the partial share (relative to the original data); this is then passed through to the cipher. and make the test for reconstruction more thorough
 * use concrete types for engines in krawczyk
 * get rid of intermediary coefficient arrays for GeometricSecretSharing pull implementation of share(byte[][], byte[]) down into concrete classes
 * parallelize rabin; we need Java 8 now
 * use one-stage look-up tables for sharing
 * directly return yValues in Share::getSerializedData when not using IC
 * enable information checking in Shamir engine; tests add stern warning when doing partial reconstruction
 * bump version in preparation of interface changes
 * bump share version in preparation of interface changes
 * refactor Shares to support fingerprinting; rename engines
 * restore partial reconstruction test for CSS engine
 * add corruption tests for CSS engine
 * hide stuff behind a factory

 * adapt sequence diagram to recent changes
 * add possibility to CSS to have all generated keys encrypted

Thomas Lor√ºnser (2):
