Version 0.2
===========

WIP:

* switch from flexiprovider to bouncy-castle (which would include
  the same library anyways)
* drop support for java 1.6 -- it's not maintained anymore
* restructure class hierarchy
* introduce CevallosEngine and RabinBenOrEngine, those two provide
  a very simple high-level interface for working with archistar-smc*
* make mathematic helper modular and introduce different implementations.
  this reduces performance for now but should lead to a cleaner
	implementation in the long term
* introduce GF(257) mathematics. This was needed for the also newly
  introduced NTT-based encoder/decoders

* improved some documentation and formatting
* fixed minor formatting errors
* readded checkForZeros()
* implemented CevallosUSRSS

Gary Ye (10):

* Two logical errors: the points were not distinct and the number of faulty points can be less than wanted. Fixed this by generating random and distinct integers with a helper method.
* The numbers will be increased in range [1, 255] now.
* Adjusted the gitignore files to ignore eclipse and OS X meta files.
* Fixed a boundary check bug.
* Saved a little bit memory.
* Changed the elimination round algorithm from O(n^3) to O(n^2)
* Formatted and using queue
* Removed the try and catch block which caused the error.
* Parameterized  EncryptionAlgorithm and added test
* Commented out bug

Version 0.0.0
=============

Franca-Sofia Fehrenbach wrote an initial prototype. It was not incorporated
into the current software project in its then form ao I am adding this so
that her contributions are not forgotten.
