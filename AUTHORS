Archistar was originally created in 2013 at the Austrian
Insititute of Technology (http://www.ait.ac.at), Vienna,
Austria by Franca-Sofia Fehrenbach under supervision of
Thomas Loruenser. Later on the source code was refactored
by Andreas Happe.

The PRIMARY Authors (so far) are:

 * Franca-Sofia Fehrenbach
 * Andreas Happe (andreashappe@snikt.net)
 * Thomas Loruenser (thomas.loruenser@ait.ac.at)

And here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made Archistar that much better:

 * TBD
